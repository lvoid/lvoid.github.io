Software Engineer specializing in Qt/QML, embedded systems, Linux, and general desktop and touchscreen application development.  

I have professional experience in a wide variety of areas, including Android, machine learning, UI design, data mining, JavaFX, and web application development.  Tehnical writing is something I love doing as well. 

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Richmond in 2017 and hold certifications in Linux+ and Security+.

Zero social media and an advocate of privacy and a focused and meaningful life lived by a personal sense of what is right.

More interested in the human condition than boolean statements.  Yet I here I remain, writing software.  It's not too bad.

I enjoy writing, reading, video games, piano, languages, weightlifting, traveling to different countries, and peace and quiet.

I'm in the process writing a novel that blends horror, science fiction, and some philosophy of consciousness together.

I wish I could draw vast, post apocalyptic environments. The kinds that I always imagine in my head and see in my dreams. Maybe it's something I will work on. Some day.
