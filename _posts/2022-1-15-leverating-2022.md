## Chronological Marker

People often use the new year as the origin point of new goals, or resolutions that they'd like to accomplish.  Transformations that they'd like to undergo.  Promises to themselves or others that they'd like to keep.  The Earth has evolved around the sun, once again.  And now people take advantage of it, seeing it as an external metric that they can build from.

I always thought that new year resolutions were a farce.  That if someone had the intention of accomplishing a goal or making a change within themselves, then it should happen any time.  They shouldn't wait.  But you know what?  I'm on board with it this time around, but from a more nuanced perspective.

There is a distinct metaphysical change that I can detect within myself and the world when a new year hits.  Is it placebo?  Imagined?  For the purposes of what I want to do, that does not matter.  It feels like a novel beginning, and that's good enough for me.

I've been planning and thinking quite meticulously from the start of this new year.  There is no going back, we must look toward the future, as it's ours for the taking.  It is the not-yet-existent plane of reality in which all of our plans may come to fruition, and the place in which transformation will take place over time with a series of deliberate decisions and efforts.  

We only live once and life is not very long.  Let's take advantage of this and live with no regrets stemming from the perpetual procrastination of our deepest desires and goals.  Why would we do that to ourself?  It is an act of self-love to fight for what you want, to put in the time and effort required to actualization.

Here are the structures that will characterize my 2022.

## Creative Projects

I am still in the process of writing my first novel.  And this is the year that I am going to finish the first draft at least.  This is pretty much my top priority outside of my career.

The motivation and need for this no longer stems from just wanting to "write a book."  I'm now far too invested in the story and the characters for this goal to make sense.  It has become about needing to truly tell the story of Svea and Mikko, two extractors who find themselves on an unfamiliar planet, full of death, uncertainty, and deception.  As I write, it does not feel like I am creating out of thin air.  It feels like on some level, this story already exists.  All I'm going is uncovering it and putting it into words.  And with my words and my story and my characters, I am expressing myself and what I think about life.  I am exploring my own neuroses and some of my deepest questions that have occupied my mind for the majority of my life.
