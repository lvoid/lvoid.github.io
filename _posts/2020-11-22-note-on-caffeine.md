I've been consuming caffeine most of the time in a given year since my senior year of high school.  The side effects of my consumption were insidious, as in they crept up so slowly and with such consistency that I thought they were simply facets of my personality and daily experience that I had to accept.  Procrastination, social anxiety, racing thoughts, OCD-like thinking and behaviors, a sense of background anxiety and stress that didn't correlate with anything happening in my immediate environment, chronic fatigue that would take place during the latter half of the day, having muted and inaccessible emotions.

The times that I really quit, went through withdrawals, and came out on the other side to reach a baseline were some of the best, most enjoyable and productive periods of my life.

It's incredible what seems to happen to me when I stop.  I am much, much calmer in thought, speech, and action.  I don't feel a need to talk just to fill the void or distract me from something else.  I think about what I'm going to say to a greater degree.  In general, it's easier to be mindful of whatever it is I'm doing as in I'm able to consciously recognize and question whatever it is that I'm doing and if it's helpful and beneficial to my goals and values, or if it serves me no purpose.  And I seem to give even less of a damn of what other people think of me.

I thought that caffeine and coffee gifted me with improved concentration and helped my work.  But what was really happening was an artificial jolt and sense of urgency that caused a casade of shallow work and distractions to take place.  The type of feeling where you think whatever you are doing is the most important thing in the world, but at the same time, you're highly distractable.  

In a sense, stimulants seem to cause me artificially-induced ADHD instead of helping it.  No wonder I was so tired before half of the day was over.

Without caffeine, I can settle quickly and deeply into work, especially creative work.  Things are easier to start, perhaps because I no longer have this great sense of urgency and panic welling inside of me, and I'm not nearly as highly attuned into my physical surroundings or tense bodily sensations.  I become conscious of the fact that it isn't all or nothing, and that things can even be fun and enjoyable instead of another check box to mark off of my to-do list.

In other words, the process becomes my focal point instead of the end goal.  In my eyes, that's a life that is far more enjoyable.  Afterall, you live in the process, not the final state.

It seems that caffeine not only creates problems where none exist, but amplifies the less than desirable aspects of my being.  Without it, I am more patient, methodical, creative, and I am able to really be in the moment and connect with other people when I talk with them.  I listen instead of thinking about what I'm going to say next.  And I listen to my body when it needs rest and relaxation, as well.

The creativity is a big thing.  When we are stressed out, this higher order thinking is more difficult to access and work with.  Menial, repetitive, shallow tasks become a safe haven while the important high-level tasks that really make a difference are avoided.

As a whole, I think caffeine is affecting our society more than we'd care to admit.  I really wonder what would happen if caffeine in all sources disappeared tomorrow and people went through withdrawal.  Would there be less anger and hostility?  Less road rage and accidents?  Less workaholism once people are more conscious of what is important to them in their life?

I don't have any evidence for this, but I think things would be a bit better.

Maybe I will consume caffeine again someday.  But for now, I'm going to enjoy being free of stimulants and having a clearer mind after a night of impeccable, deep sleep.
