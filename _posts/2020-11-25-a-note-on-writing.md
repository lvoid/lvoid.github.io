Starting is always the most difficult thing.  It is for me, at least.

Before I begin creating something, I typically have a vision in my head of the way it should turn out.  The vision is often quite grandiose and ungrounded in reality.  As a consequence, I dread beginning the implementation, because on some visceral level I realize that at worst my vision will never come to fruition, and at best, it's going to take a lot of painstaking work to get there.

It's almost as if I visualize the entire span of work that will have to go into something, and the feeling from all of those discrete experiences combining into something continuous and overwhelming hits me at once.  And the last thing I want to do is open a text editor and start typing, because why start in the first place if I know what's coming?

Then I sometimes start working on impulse.  In other words, I do the hardest part and I start without thinking.  What I find is that I am enjoying myself.  I find that I derive an immense amount of satisfaction from getting anything done at all, no matter how small it may be.

I remember when I used to receive large, seemingly overwhelming tasks at my first job and express my sentiment to my more experienced coworker of "How do we even begin?"  He reminded me of what we learned in college, and what any computer science major should know - divide and conquer.

You need to break things into the smallest components and complete them separately, and then work to combine them into a whole.  As small and insignificant as you can possibly work with.  And then you need to take this methodology and apply it to any aspect of your life where the obstacle seems insurmountable.

It's the same with writing.

In my spare time, I'm trying to become a better writer.  Writing is something that I've always liked to do, but never really realized that I liked to do.  It wasn't until I started reflecting on my life that I saw writing as an outlet.  For the longest time, I've been longing for some sort of creative medium besides programming.  Something to express my internal reflections and emotional states.  Programming will simply not suffice for this.  So here I am, not only trying to write a novel, but trying to improve the craft of writing however I can.

I find that what helps is taking time whenever possible to write.  It may be some reflections, it may be a video game review.  I might open up a text editor and stare at it blankly for 30 minutes while feelings of dumbfoundedness and incompetence wash over me, blaming my inability to produce anything on built up fatigue from the work day.  But I need to push past that and continue on, even if what I create is far less than ideal.

When you start focusing on the process rather than the end result, or the desire for the end result, you begin to really live life.  You realize that what you are currently doing does not have to be perfect, and indeed, if it's a creative endeavor, actually suffers from the imposition of too many practical and realistic rules and constraints.  The *flow* state is all.  It allows the emissions to flow through you like a conduit and into whatever it is that you produce.

Day after day, continuous production, revision, and reflection builds upon itself, and you realize that you have eventually achieved something close to the vision in your head, or at least have become very good at something.

My current writing abilities, and really, the ability to express myself and my thoughts is nowhere close to where I want it to be.  But it's not going to get any better unless I accept the current state of things and realize my limitations, take responsibility for my inactions and excuses, and then begin consistent, concentrated effort free of self-judgement.

You reach your goals when you are congruent.  That is, you possess the alignment of thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions towards a singular theme without sparing any room for contradictions.
