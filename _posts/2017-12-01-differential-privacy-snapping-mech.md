## Background

Differential Privacy is a property of algorithms which aims to provide reasonable accuracy on queries from databases while preserving
the privacy of the users in these databases from various attacks.  A wealth of information on this important field can be found
[here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf), and the formal definiton of Differential Privacy taken from 
Dwork and Roth can be found below.

Unfortunately, as thoroughly outlined by Mironov in his paper, [*On significance of the least significant bits for differential
privacy*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/on-significance-of-the-least-significant-bits-for-differential-privacy/), 
real-life, floating point implementations of several noise generation methods for differentially private algorithms such as 
the Laplace mechanism result in differential privacy breaches due to the finite precision and rounding effects of floating 
point operations.

To overcome this vulnerability, Mironov developed the *Snapping Mechanism*, which can serve as a replacement for the Laplac
e Mechanism where noise is added to some query **f(D)** on some database **D**.  A mathematical overview of the snapping mechanism
is shown below.

The snapping mechanism, and thus our implementation of the snapping mechanism, has been proven to satisfy
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?1/\lambda+2^{-49}\mathrm{B}/\lambda" border="0"/> - *differential privacy* when
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda<\mathrm{B}<2^{46}\lambda" border="0"/>, 
where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda=\Delta/\epsilon}" border="0"/>

The source code for our project can be found [here](https://github.com/jjgccg/DP-Snapping-Mech)

## Implementation

We've modeled the snapping mechanism as accurately as possible through the creation of a Rust program which can be called as
a function.  The uniform distribution **U** over <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{D}\cap(0,1)" border="0"/>
was implemented by randomly sampling a number from the open interval (0.0,1.0), which contains all possible 64-bit floating point
values.

The snapping mechanism function is implemented in two versions:

```rust
fn snapping_mechanism(fD: f64, lambda: f64, B: f64) -> f64
```
```rust
fn snapping_mechanism_2(fD: f64, lambda: f64) -> f64
```

In the first version, the user can specify their own value of **B** in addition to their privacy parameter, **Î»**.  
In the second version, **B** is fixed to be <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda\cdot2^{45}" border="0"/>, allowing for a large range of values to be output.

In both cases, the snapping mechanism function returns a 64-bit floating point number which is the result of adding noise to 
some query **f(D)** in a secure and differentially private way.

## Running the Rust Program

Our program was developed and run on a Linux environment, with the latest versions of Rust and Cargo installed.  Since the snapping
mechanism functions are declared as ```pub```, they can be called from another Rust file which may require the use of secure and
differentially private noise.

Download the repository and navigate to the source code folder and ```cargo run```.

```main.rs``` is currently set up as a demo so the user can modify the parameters for the snapping mechanism call, and then see the
result printed out from calling the function.  Additionally, a function which stores the result in a text file of calling the
snapping mechanism with fixed parameters **n** times is currently called inside of main for the purpose of plotting the
distribution of output values.  Of course, this can be removed if need be.

## Python FFI

Not everyone who develops a differentially private algorithm may do so in Rust.  Languages such as Python are more widely used and
popular.  Rust was used to implement the snapping mechanism simply because of its precision, security, and performance.

Keeping this in mind, we have developed an FFI call to our Rust snapping mechanism implementation in a Python program to model
a practical use case.  The Python program is an implementation of the *Subsample and Aggregate* algorithm, which can be found in
section 7.1 of [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf).

Inside of the ```python_rust_ffi``` directory, you can find the subsample and aggregate algorithm, which creates a foreign function
call on the Rust program in the following way, using ```FFI``` from ```cffi```

```python
ffi = FFI()

#C function signature matching Rust "snapping_mech"
ffi.cdef( """
    double snapping_mechanism(double, double, double);
""")

C = ffi.dlopen("/home/osboxes/Desktop/DP/target/debug/libsnapping_mech.so")
```

This code creates a file called ```libsnapping_mech.so``` inside of your debug folder in your Rust code directory which we originally
created through using the ```cargo run``` command.  Note that if you are using windows, this file should instead
be ```libsnapping_mech.dll```, and also note the user of this python file must change the path in ```ffi.dlopen``` to match their
own machine directory structure.

Once this FFI object is created, it is later called in place of Laplace noise as such

```python
noisy_stability = C.snapping_mechanism(d, delta/eps, 1000.0) # FFI call to rust snapping_mechanism
```

Using this method of a Python to Rust function call (from which we express our gratitude to
[this](https://bheisler.github.io/post/calling-rust-in-python/) tutorial), a programmer can create an algorithm in Python which
requires the use of Laplace noise and instead call the snapping mechanism implemented in Rust.
